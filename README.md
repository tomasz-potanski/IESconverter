Academic project for engineering bachelor's degree thesis. The aim of the program is to conduct basic calculation (and draw specific graphs) connected with photometric data. Two algorithms were applied:
    
1. Algorithm transforming given IES file and room parameters into illuminance distribution
2. Algorithm transforming illuminance distribution and room parameters into IES file

Main formula applied in this project was the formula of the inverse square law. The program was written in JAVA which ensures its mobility (it works on any system with latest JRE installed without any source code modification) and allows future development in direction of web (e.g. Spring MVC) or mobile phones (e.g. Android SDK).
