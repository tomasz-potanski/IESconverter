IESconverter
============

IESconverter: program for bachelor's degree thesis. 

    Academic project for engineering bachelor's degree thesis. The aim of the program is to conduct basic calculation (and draw specific graphs) connected
with photometric data. Two algorithms were applied:

--Algorithm transforming given IES file and room parameters into illuminance
distribution

--Algorithm transforming illuminance distribution and room parameters
into IES file

    Main formula applied in this project was the formula of the inverse square law. The program was written in JAVA which ensures its mobility (it works
on any system with latest JRE installed without any source code modification) and allows future development in direction of web (e.g. Spring MVC)
or mobile phones (e.g. Android SDK).
